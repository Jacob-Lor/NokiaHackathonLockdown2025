> We believe the elderly would be the most impacted group in our society in the event of a lockdown. So we asked ourselves, ‚Äú How can we provide a way for the elderly to stay connected and find joy in the dark times of a lockdown?‚Äù With this question in mind, we developed an easy-to-use web app that keeps our beloved seniors connected while allowing them to play their favourite games!
