Inspiration
From our experience with our grandparents, we are well aware of their technological and social challenges. With Vigorium we wished to remedy these perceived hurdles.

What it does
Vigorium brings the traditionally technologically inept advanced senior populous to the forefront of social buzz through connecting elders with gaming. By creating a structured environment where they can engage with each other and with game, we hope to both improve their awareness of technology and their social health.

How we built it
We built this website leveraging Django, a python web framework, CSS, Html, Javascript and AI tools such as ChatGPT to create this application.

Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge we ran into was the hurdle of finding free tools to leverage, such as free AI models or platforms to host our website. As a result of this, we were not able to implement the AI chatbot which he had envisioned to help seniors engage with technology.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're most proud of intuitive interface of this project.

What we learned
During this project, we learned the importance of breaking down problems into sub issues. By leveraging this technique we were able to distribute our workload among each other in an efficient manner such that we didn't get in each others way.

What's next for Vigorium
Potential funding to allow Vigorium to function at it's full and envisioned capacity to help the elderly. We're always improving Vigorium!
